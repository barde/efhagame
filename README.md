﻿efhagame
======================================

Description:
------------

* This game is nuts
* All correleation with existing things is purely coincidential or just happened by inspiration


Installation
------------

First you need to install [GIT](http://git-scm.com/) on your local host which is connected to the controlling node.
If you use Debian: `apt-get install git`

Afterwards you get the rolling-release version with:
`git clone git@github.com:barde/efhagame.git`

`cd efhagame` and `python game.py` should put up some kind of window with the game.

For playing 'pygame' must be installed.
For Debian systems: `apt-get install python-pygame`.
   

Usage
------

Probably educational purposes as the png file is replaceable with whatever you desire.

Very Boring legal stuff
