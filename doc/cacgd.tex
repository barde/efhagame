\begin{abstract}

    In this report about the practical part of the ``Computational Aspects of Computer Games Development'' programme for two weeks in Crete a
    game programming with the Python programming language is described. The controller is a neural interface for brainwave wavelength reception 
    through three skin-applied electrodes. The game is themed after a fictional Cretan Zombie incursion after the actual event.

This written documentation is a part of the two week conference and tutored exercises in the Cretan state capital Iraklion. The host was the
Technical Educational Institute of Crete, a university with emphasis on applied technology. The conference preparation was done especially through the 
department of Computer Sciences, visible through the timetable.\footnote{Available at \url{https://cacgd2011.teicrete.gr/?q=content/program-lectures}.}.

The author of this work was part of the team from the German Fachhochschule Kiel and reported his personal experience in an formerly online available
diary. This report is supposed to contain the technical description of the proceeding practical lessen from the excursion. Worthwhile to mention 
members of the other college teams were not bound for such task as it functions as an addition to the regular curriculum of the event.
Skills learned should be applied in the resulting game or educational entertainment tool.

Other members of the authors team presented their own results, i.e. a location-based game and a helicopter simulation for children on a mobile platform.

The task was done without the acquired technique of proper software engineering. Instead, a more spontaneous and agile development process was
chosen due to the small team size and new field of work.

The author wants to express his gratitude for having the option to experience Greece and learn new ways of thinking.
