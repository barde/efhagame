Some steps are required before using the game with a customized brain interface.

First, we need to gather some data from the brain interface.
This is done with:
python brain.py -o CSVFILE

Next step is to train the neural network with the parametres. This is done with:
python ai.py -t -i CSVFILE

Now a file called lastNetwork.xml should be available in the current directory. This contains the 
network with its customized parametres. This file should be kept save as every next step depends on it.

The other method is to just run it without the file so it will be created on-line!
